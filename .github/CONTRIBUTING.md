# Contributing to lucid

Your slightest contribution can help make the GUI development ecosystem in Rust
an even better place, so hop on!

## How lucid handles contributions

The primary place for contributions is via my (arHSM) personal Discord server as
I'm primarily active on Discord. You can join through the following invite
[HEpk6q9kYM][server].

After discussing about the concerning contribution and receiving the necessary
approvals you may go forward with creating a Pull Request or an Issue.

Pull Requests are thoroughly reviewed and finally merged to be released in the
next version bump.

Issues are added to the Github Project to be kept track of in accordance to
their priority.

## Key to good Issues/PRs

- Choose the correct Issue/PR template
- Make sure to fill in every detail properly
- Provide as much information as possible
- Use the search functionality for precedents
- Follow the [Code Of Conduct Standards][coc-standards]
- Provide a quick background/motivation/explanation/summary
- Provide reproduction steps if applicable
- Write your expected result and current result
- Note changes to the changelog according to [keepachangelog][changelog]
- Add necessaary documentation for public and private api (this makes contributing a pleasant experience)

## Consistency

When contributing you must maintain consistency with the existing code-base

- Use 4 Spaces for indentation
- Run rustfmt periodically and when submitting your PR
- Keep naming styles consistent, `snake_case`, `PascalCase` & `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
